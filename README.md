# Stock Exchange LSTM Neural Network

Recurrent neural network composed of long short-term memory units in order to make attempts to forecast future stock prices based on past data.

## Usage
Use the following command in the project directory: `python3 lstm_stock.py [ticker] [startdate=MM/DD/YYYY] [enddate=MM/DD/YYYY]`<br>
(e.g. `python3 lstm_stock.py AAPL 01/17/2014 02/11/2018`)
